## How to read this book?
Go through the questions and once you find a topic that you donâ€™t understand give it a look.
Most of the topics in linux you can actually read in 10-20 min if we exclude networking. So if
you are not able to solve the question read the topics and attempt again.


## Who should read this book?
Anyone who has an interview scheduled in less than a week, this week will help you in the
final revision of your preparations. Please note that good understanding of networking and
linux takes a good amount of reading and working experience. I highly recommend people
who want to move to this field to go through and read them as much as possible.
